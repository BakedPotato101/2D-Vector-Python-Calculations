# 2D-Vector-Python-Calculations
These are a few python programs I wrote to find the component form of a vector from 2 given points, the magnitude of a vector in component form, the direction angle of a vector in component form, and the angle between 2 vectors. 

To use, simply type into your terminal: python3 /2D-Vector-Python-Calculations/ANYPROGRAM.py
You will then be prompted to give values depending upon which program you dicided to run
The console's output after running will be your answer.

These programs were written for a project in Pre-Calculus where we needed to find the different attributes of a vector between two cities using longitude and latitude converted to decimal.
